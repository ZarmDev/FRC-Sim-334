# How to build

1. Set Up Boost in Visual Studio
Open your Visual Studio project.

Go to Project Properties:

Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select Properties.

Navigate to Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General:

Add the path to the Boost include directory (e.g., C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_0) in Additional Include Directories.

Navigate to Configuration Properties > Linker > General:

Add the path to the Boost lib directory (e.g., C:\Boost\lib) in Additional Library Directories.

2. Link Boost Libraries (If Needed)
If you're using Boost libraries that require linking (e.g., Boost.Serialization), navigate to Configuration Properties > Linker > Input.

Add the required .lib files (e.g., libboost_serialization-vc142-mt-x64-1_xx.lib) to Additional Dependencies.

3. Build Boost (If Required)
Some Boost libraries are header-only and don't require building (e.g., Boost.SmartPtr).

For libraries that need to be built (e.g., Boost.Serialization), use the b2 tool:

Open a command prompt.

Navigate to the Boost root directory.

Run the following command:

bash
bootstrap.bat
b2
This will build the required Boost binaries.
